-----------------------

This is the first release of the EESSI test suite.

It includes:

* Tests for GROMACS and TensorFlow in `eessi.testsuite.tests.apps` that leverage the functionality provided by `eessi.testsuite.*`.
* Examples of ReFrame configuration files for various systems in the `config` subdirectory.
* A `common_logging_config()` function to facilitate the ReFrame logging configuration.
* A set of standard device types and features that can be used in the partitions section of the ReFrame configuration file.
* A set of tags (CI + scale) that can be used to filter checks.
* Scripts that show how to run the test suite.
