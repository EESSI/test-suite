# Hooks from the Mixin class seem to be executed _before_ those of the child class
# Thus, if the Mixin class needs self.X to be defined in after setup, the child class would have to define it before
# setup. That's a disadvantage and might not always be possible - let's see how far we get. It also seems that,
# like normal inheritance, functions with the same in the child and parent class will mean the child class
# will overwrite that of the parent class. That is a plus, as we can use the EESSI_Mixin class as a basis,
# but still overwrite specific functions in case specific tests would require this
# TODO: for this reason, we probably want to put _each_ hooks.something invocation into a seperate function,
# so that each individual one can be overwritten
#
# Note that I don't think we can do anything about the things set in the class body, such as the parameter's.
# Maybe we can move those to an __init__ step of the Mixin, even though that is not typically how ReFrame
# does it anymore?
# That way, the child class could define it as class variables, and the parent can use it in its __init__ method?
